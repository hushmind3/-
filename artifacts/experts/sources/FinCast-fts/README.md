FinCast is a **decoder-only transformer** trained on over **20B financial time points** across diverse domains and temporal resolutions.  
Technical Highlights:
- **PQ-Loss**: Joint point + probabilistic forecasting.
- **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)**: Specialization across domains.

---

## 🔥 Features
- Foundation model for **financial time-series forecasting**, flexible input and output length.
- Strong performance in **zero-shot**, **supervised**, and **few-shot** settings.
- Modular architecture with **MoE** and **quantile-aware loss**.
- Scalable to **1 billion of parameters** with efficient inference.

## 📦 Installation

- The model weight can be found on 🤗 https://huggingface.co/Vincent05R/FinCast
- The model code can be found on https://github.com/vincent05r/FinCast-fts
- The corresponding datasets to reproduce the results can be found on https://huggingface.co/datasets/Vincent05R/FinCast-Paper-test

Run the env_setup.sh first then run the dep_install.sh. We use conda as the venv management.

## 📊 Experiments

- run the corresponding scripts in the scripts directory to reproduce the results in the paper. The result summary can be generate using the result summary notebook in the notebook directory.


## 📈 Inference

FinCast supports **training-free inference** — simply download a checkpoint and start forecasting.  

✨ **Key Inference Features**  
- ⚡ **Plug-and-Play**: *No training required*. Just load a checkpoint and run inference.  
- 📏 **Flexible Context & Horizon**: Choose **any input length** and **any forecast length**.  
- 🔥 **Flexible time frequency and asset types!**: Choose **any frequency** and **any financial assets** such as stock, crypto, futures, forex.  
- 🎲 **Probabilistic Forecasting**: Native **quantile outputs** for uncertainty & risk analysis.  
- 🎯 **High Accuracy**: State-of-the-art performance across **financial benchmarks**.  

📘 See the **Inference Notebook** for quick start examples.

## ⚡ Future Updates

- PEFT finetune(LORA/DORA) is done, just need to do some testing  
- Covariate Inference(currently implemented the same code as timesfm)
